Test strategy:

1. The system and its components are being examined based on the provided diagram and documentation.
2. Test automation objectives are defined, such as data integrity verification and system stability validation.
3. Testing scenarios, including positive and negative tests, have been identified.
4. Appropriate automation tools are selected for different testing types.
5. Prioritization of testing types is determined according to component importance.
6. Test data sets representing various scenarios are prepared for data processing, routing, and integration testing.
7. Automated tests for the web UI are created using suitable tools like Selenium.
8. Automation scripts for the CLI are developed to validate command-line operations.
9. Automated tests for the REST API are implemented using tools like Postman or Newman.
10. Integration testing is performed to validate data flow between components.
11. Performance testing is conducted to evaluate scalability, throughput, and response times.
12. Security testing is carried out to identify vulnerabilities, especially in encryption and secure connections.
13. Tests for the High-Volume Agent (HVA) functionality, connectivity, and compatibility are created.
14. Tests for agent-less connectivity to remote database locations are conducted.
15. Detailed test reporting mechanisms are implemented, capturing logs, screenshots, and error messages.
16. Automation tests are integrated into the CI/CD pipeline for automatic execution.
17. A suite of regression tests is maintained to prevent regressions in existing functionality.
18. Comprehensive documentation is kept for test cases, data, and automation scripts.
19. Dedicated test environments mirroring production setups are maintained.
20. Regular test executions, including smoke tests and comprehensive suites, are scheduled.
21. Test data management strategies, including data generation and cleanup, are implemented.
22. Test execution is monitored to quickly identify issues and ensure stability.
23. Automation script maintenance is performed regularly to adapt to system changes.
24. Continuous improvement of the test automation strategy is pursued based on feedback and evolving requirements.
25. Training is provided to team members responsible for test execution and maintenance.
